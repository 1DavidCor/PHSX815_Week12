I chose to look at the data columns in this file that I thought would carry the most information or be the most reflective of real-world, unseen variables. This file plots the geographic distribution of the institutions found in the data set. Obviously, this produces a map that looks like the United States!! It also sorts the institutions according to those that are religioulsy affiliated and those that are not. Similarly, the institutions are also sorted into Predominantly White Institutions (PWIs) and non-PWIs. Finally, I produce a plot of Tuition rates over time to see if there is any trend i.e. increasing or decreasing tuition rates.

This program helps demonstarte the Central Limit Theorem. According to the Central Limit Theorem, the normalized sum (i.e. the arithmetic mean) of random variables, each independently sampled from the same distribution, will asymptotically follow a Gaussian distribution. So, this program samples from an exponential random distribution N times and calculates the average of the dataset. The process is repeated for a total of M experiments. Then, the script shows how the histograms of the average distributions vary for different number of N [N, 10N, 50N, 100N, 500N, 1000N]. A Gaussian is fitted to each of these six experiments, and we see that as N gets larger, the distribution of averages asymptotically approaches a Gaussian distribution since the mean and standard deviation of the Gaussian fits tend to a certain value (2 and 0.3 respectively, in this case).
