PHSX815_HW12.py:

I chose to look at the data columns in this file that I thought would carry the most information or be the most reflective of real-world, unseen variables. This file plots the geographic distribution of the institutions found in the data set. Obviously, this produces a map that looks like the United States!! It also sorts the institutions according to those that are religioulsy affiliated and those that are not. Similarly, the instituions are also sorted into Predominantly White Institutions (PWIs) and non-PWIs. Finally, I produce a plot of Tuition rates over time to see if there is any trend i.e. increasing or decreasing tuition rates.
